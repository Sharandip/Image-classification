# Olive Leaf Image Classification
##Introduction

In this project a dataset of 3400 olive leaf images collected from Denizli city of Turkey during spring and summer are given. Three classes of these images:

1. Leaf images infected with Aculus olearius.
2. Leaf images infected with Olive peacock spot.
3. Leaf images with healthy leaves.

##Objective

1. Load and prepare images for modeling.
2. Develop a convolutional neural network for image classification.
3. Develop a model for image classification using transfer learning.
